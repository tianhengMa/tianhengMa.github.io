I am a software engineer passionate about mobile game development, currently leading the engineering team for WORDLE!. My core expertise lies in Unity development, where I create efficient, scalable solutions to bring engaging gameplay experiences to life.

Beyond mobile games, I have also developed AR/VR applications in Unity, exploring the potential of immersive technologies. I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and working with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality projects.
